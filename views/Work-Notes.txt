Social Features Checklist:


- Making an account:
  - Add maximum username length
  - Make sure it only contains the characters you want

- For all routes:
  - If a user must be logged in to view a page, make sure that it checks their login status first.
  - Spoof-proof: Don't assume a request's representation of facts is correct. Check the details against your database.

- Blocking a user (think about how this should be implemented)
- Captcha and such for account creation, maybe login too
- Add email for password regen options


- Friend request stuff:
  - Can't request someone who's already your friend
  - Can't request someone who's already in your request inbox OR outbox
  - Can't request yourself

- For all database calls:
  - Instead of nesting each change inside the previous change's success code, I think I might can make one big Params that does it all! (look into this)
